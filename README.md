# Comicdb
Comic Warehouse Management written in Rust.

## Goal

I made this program for my aunt so she can manage comic storage :). 
It is far from perfect and i might polish it sometime in the future but for now it is just what she needs to start managing comic storage. 

## Features

- Insert Comics inside the DataBase
- Search by title directly on AnimeClick.it
- Import Comic data gathered from Chrome Extension
- Load & Unload Comic 
- Manage imported comics


## Future dev
These are not planned yet but might be usefull for future upgrades:
-  Extract and sync data gathered from users (my aunt) to create an OpenSource global database for comics.
